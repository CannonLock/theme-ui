# Flex

Use the `Flex` component to create flexbox layouts.

```js
import { Flex } from 'theme-ui'
```

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap={2}>
  <Box p={2} bg="primary" sx={{ flex: '1 1 auto' }}>
    Flex
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} bg="muted">
    Box
  </Box>
</Flex>
```

Supports the `gap` prop for space between child elements, which can be a [responsive array][].

[responsive array]: /sx-prop#responsive-values

<Note>

The `Flex` component is identical to the `Box` component, but with `display: flex` set.
If you need to alter the `display` property, use the `Box` component instead.
